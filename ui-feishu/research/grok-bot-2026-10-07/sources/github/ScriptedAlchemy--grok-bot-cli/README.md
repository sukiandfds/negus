## Install

```sh
npm install --global grok-bot-cli
```

Requires Node.js 22.19.0+ and the Grok Bot desktop app on macOS, Linux, or Windows. Open Grok Bot and sign in once; `gbot` automatically uses the app's encrypted session and routing credentials. No token copying is required. On Linux the app keeps its session under `~/.config/Grok Bot` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`); when it is stored in the system keyring, `gbot` reads the key with `secret-tool` (package `libsecret-tools`). On Windows the session lives under `%APPDATA%\\Grok Bot` and decrypts with the app's DPAPI-wrapped Safe Storage key.

## Use

```sh
gbot bots list
gbot bots create --name Researcher
gbot bots update Researcher --description "Research the launch" --notify on
gbot bots create --name Writer
gbot groups create --name Launch --member Researcher --member Writer --description "Ship together"
gbot groups update Launch --title "Launch room" --hidden off
gbot send Researcher "Summarize the launch status."
gbot send Launch "Share your updates."
gbot thread Researcher
gbot thread Researcher --after <last-entry-id> --json
gbot skills list
gbot skills add ./skills/poteto-mode
gbot skills remove poteto-mode
gbot groups delete Launch
gbot bots delete Researcher
gbot bots delete Writer
```

`update` fields: `--name` `--description` `--title` `--avatar-shape` `--avatar-color` `--notify on|off` `--hidden on|off`. `--description` is the UI Instructions field.

`gbot skills` manages the skill library over the gateway. Grok Bot keeps one
library per account; every bot reads the same list, and there is no per-bot
attach. `add` posts a `SKILL.md` (or a directory holding one) and every bot sees
it. `list` shows each entry's `source`: `workflow` is your library, `managed` is
team-published, `plugin` comes from a marketplace install, `automation` is a
scheduled routine. `remove` deletes a `workflow` skill by id or exact name, for
every bot, and refuses the other sources. Adding the same file twice yields two
same-named skills; remove by id then. There is no `--files` mode for skills.

`gbot thread --after ID` filters the bounded tail locally and returns entries strictly
after that opaque entry ID. Its JSON includes `cursor`, `entryCount`, and `gapReset`.
An unchanged poll has `entryCount: 0`; an unknown or expired ID returns one bounded
snapshot with `gapReset: true`. The gateway request remains limit-only.

Run `gbot --help` for every command.
Options are command-local (for example, `gbot send --history-dir DIR ...`);
`--json` prints the canonical JSON result; `send` and the `codex` commands also report failures as
a JSON document on stdout with `exitCode` (see below), every other command
prints the failure message on stderr and exits 1.

## Messaging a live Claude Code session

Claude Code has a native [Channels API](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels-reference),
so this integration needs no desktop shim. The Claude plugin includes an opt-in
`claude-channel` MCP server; Codex and Grok callers can use `claude_send`, or the
local CLI, to send a message and receive Claude's explicit reply.

Claude channels live on the **user's registered machine** (the same host that runs
Claude Code), not on the Grok Bot agent box (`HOME=/home/box`). gbot has no remote
transport: from the box, use Grok Bot Shell with a machineId to run
`gbot claude send` on that computer. Auth stays with that machine's native Claude login.

After installing this version of the Claude plugin, launch a named session:

```sh
GROK_BOT_CLAUDE_CHANNEL=review claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:gbot@gbot-marketplace
# From another terminal on the same machine and user account:
gbot claude send review "Reply with GBOT_CLAUDE_OK" --json
```

Accept Claude's development-channel prompt. Custom channels are a research preview
and require session opt-in and any applicable organization policy. Claude must be
signed in. The development flag permits this channel; it does not bypass tool
approvals. `claude_send` takes `name`, `message`, and optional `timeoutMs` (default
60000, maximum 120000). Claude uses `claude_reply` with the incoming `request_id`.
Only that explicit reply completes the call; a notification alone is not proof
Claude received or processed the message. Timeout/disconnect returns `unknown`;
do not automatically resend.

Each name selects one live session. Sockets live under `~/.grok-bot-cli/claude/`
in a user-owned 0700 directory, with mode 0600 sockets. Access grants messaging
to local processes running as the same user. No TCP listener, automatic permission
approval, conversation-history scraping, or background daemon is installed.
Without `GROK_BOT_CLAUDE_CHANNEL`, the channel is disabled. Shut down the owning
Claude session to close it. A crashed process may leave a socket: confirm the
named session is stopped before removing that socket and restarting. A second
session with the same name fails rather than taking over the first.

This targets opted-in Claude Code sessions, not arbitrary existing sessions or
ordinary Claude Desktop chats. Remote Grok runtimes need local tool execution to
reach the socket; installing an MCP artifact does not establish that connection.
Claude can use the existing `gbot_send`/`gbot_thread` and `codex_send` tools for
outgoing messages; its own tool permissions still apply.

## Automatic Grok ↔ Codex replies

In a native Codex invocation, `gbot_send` sends once and returns a durable exchange
receipt. Continue working: matching Grok replies arrive in the originating Codex
thread automatically. That thread's next answer is not sent back to Grok unless
you deliberately send again. The background worker survives the MCP caller exiting. Outgoing MCP tool calls
still follow the host's tool-approval policy; the bridge does not change it.

When native identity is unavailable (including Cursor), supply `codexThreadId` on
the send, or make a one-time `gbot_bridge_start` binding with `grokTarget`,
`codexThreadId` and optional `expectedCwd`. New visible Grok bot messages then arrive
in that Codex thread, and its corresponding terminal answer returns to Grok.
Existing transcript history is not replayed. `codex_send` can also request a return
with `replyToGrok` or `bindingId`. Managed delivery defaults to guarded steering of
active work; `busyPolicy: "reject"` on a binding refuses busy threads. A managed
`codex_send` can select `whenBusy` for that one delivery; omitting it uses the
binding's stored policy. An override does not change subsequent linked traffic.

**Rejections and failed turns are explained.** A managed receipt that is `rejected` carries `reason` plus `detail` (the daemon's own error text) and the CLI/MCP result adds the next step; a failed Codex turn is returned to Grok as `Codex turn failed with no final text: <Codex error>`. `--when-busy queue` is not available with `--reply-to-grok`/`bindingId` (the experimental queue cannot carry the Grok return route): omit `--when-busy` (an active turn is steered, an idle thread starts a turn), or pass `steer` / `reject`.

Without an identifiable native source or explicit route, `gbot_send` preserves the
ordinary send and returns `replyRoute: {mode: "manual", reason: "source-unavailable"}`;
read with `gbot_thread` later. `replyMode: "manual"` deliberately selects that flow.
An automatic-route startup failure never falls back to an untracked send.

```sh
# CLI sends remain manual unless routing is explicitly requested.
gbot send --reply-mode auto --codex-thread-id THREAD_ID Researcher "Please investigate"
gbot codex bridge start --codex-thread-id THREAD_ID --expected-cwd /project Researcher --json
gbot codex bridge status --json
gbot codex send --reply-to-grok Researcher THREAD_ID "Investigate and return your final answer"
gbot codex bridge stop --binding-id BINDING_ID --json
# Explicitly stop the process; pending records remain for a later restart.
gbot codex bridge stop --worker --json
```

`gbot_bridge_status` separates worker health, binding coverage, submission, execution,
return delivery and pending operator interactions. `unknown` is not rejection: inspect
status before resending. Caller-supplied `requestId` (CLI `--request-id`) permits exact
replay of a tracked send without another submission; returned `controlRequestId` is
that control identity, separate from the gateway's transcript `requestId`.
Explicit chain `hop`/`correlationId` remain bounded. Automatic CLI routes own their
envelope; omit the legacy `--envelope` and `--reply-to` flags. Managed Codex return
routes also reject explicit `expectedTurnId`/`--expected-turn-id`; use plain Codex
send when a caller-selected turn guard is required. If a binding and an explicit
Grok target are supplied together, the target must resolve to that binding's recipient.
Paused gaps/capacity or unsupported interactions need attention; never guess a cursor
or automatically approve. `gbot_codex_respond` / `gbot codex bridge respond` requires
current `interactionId`, `generation`, `threadId`, `turnId` and binding/exchange scope.
Supply one-time `decision: accept|decline|cancel`, or `answersJson` containing exact
question IDs mapped to `{"answers":["answer"]}`. Session permissions and policy
amendments remain in the owning Codex UI.

State lives in the user-owned `~/.grok-bot-cli/relay/` directory, or
`GROK_BOT_RELAY_DIR`, outside plugin caches. Profile mismatches fail visibly; gateway
overrides and thread restrictions cannot reuse a differently authorized worker.
Authentication failures use bounded retries (1..30 seconds) from the saved cursor;
restored credentials do not reset coverage or resend uncertain submissions.
No login service is installed. Network reconnects are automatic; a dead process
needs a new tracked send or bridge start to resume saved routes. A dead worker is
reported as stopped, not running.

`gbot codex bridge run --lifetime-ms 60000` runs in the foreground for an explicit
bounded lifetime (default and maximum 23 hours), then closes cleanly before the CLI
renderer deadline. For an unlimited foreground service entry, run
`node /path/to/plugin/scripts/gbot-relay.mjs` (npm package: `dist/scripts/gbot-relay.mjs`)
with the same authorized environment. SIGINT/SIGTERM or explicit worker stop closes
observation without interrupting a Codex turn. Windows retains the Codex Unix-socket
limitation.

Codex, Cursor, Claude and portable artifacts contain these tools and the worker.
Grok Bot participates through its existing gateway conversation; a native Grok plugin
loader or remote stdio tunnel has not been established. Artifact availability alone
does not mean a host has loaded the plugin.

## Gateway URL policy

By default `gbot` only sends credentials to expected hosts:

- **Gateway** URLs (box + API): `https` on `*.cursor.sh` / `*.cursor.com` / `*.cursorvm.com` (the box family EnsureSandBox returns).
- **Backend** URLs (`EnsureSandBox` / `CURSOR_API_BASE_URL`): `https` on `*.cursor.sh` / `*.cursor.com` only — never `*.cursorvm.com`, so a Cursor access token cannot be pointed at a box host.

- `GROK_BOT_ALLOW_LOCAL_GATEWAY=1` — permit `http(s)://127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, and `::1` for **gateways** only (local/dev). Prints a one-shot stderr warning.
- `GROK_BOT_ALLOW_ANY_GATEWAY=1` — disable host checks (unsafe; for break-glass only). Prints a one-shot stderr warning.

All gateway / `EnsureSandBox` fetches use `redirect: "error"` so credentials are not followed across redirects.

## Messaging Codex threads from Grok Bot

`gbot codex` attaches to a local [Codex app-server](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server) daemon and injects messages into its threads with the documented JSON-RPC methods (`initialize`, `thread/list`, `thread/resume`, `turn/start`).

```sh
codex app-server daemon start          # once per machine session
gbot codex status                      # socket, daemon version, reachability
gbot codex list-threads --limit 10     # newest activity first: id, status, cwd, updated, preview
gbot codex list-threads --query zerofs --active-within 7d   # find an old-but-active thread
gbot codex send <threadId> "Grok here: the build is green, please continue."
gbot codex send --model gpt-6-astra --effort high <threadId> "Review this change"
gbot codex new --cwd /path/to/project --model gpt-6-astra --effort high "Start here"
gbot codex wait <threadId> <turnId> --timeout-ms 1800000
```

`send` resumes the thread, starts a turn with your text, prints the turn id, and returns; Codex keeps working after `gbot` disconnects. Every command accepts `--json`.

`send` and MCP `codex_send` accept optional `model` and `effort` overrides (`none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`). `gbot codex new` and MCP `codex_new` use `thread/start` to create a thread with a required cwd and optional model, effort, and first message. Use `--expected-cwd` to guard the selected directory. `wait` accepts a caller timeout up to two hours and reconciles turn history after notification floods.

**Which Codex you reach.** `gbot` connects to `$CODEX_HOME/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock` (default `~/.codex/...`) or the existing local socket set by `CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCK`, with a built-in WebSocket client. The daemon must be started by `codex app-server daemon start`. `list-threads` shows the threads recorded under `CODEX_HOME` (CLI, TUI, VS Code); `send` uses the resumed thread state and selected busy policy: ordinary sends reject active work, while explicitly selected guarded steering can deliver into the active turn. Method and parameter names are pinned to the Codex release recorded in `src/core/codex-bridge.js` (`codex app-server generate-json-schema`); `status` prints the daemon and CLI versions so a stale daemon is visible, and `codex app-server daemon restart` picks up the installed CLI. Native Windows is not supported yet (AF_UNIX control socket); use WSL, Linux, or macOS.

**User machines, not the Grok Bot box.** Codex must run on the same machine as gbot. Codex (and Claude) sessions live on the user's registered computers — for example their Linux desktop or Mac — not on the Grok Bot agent's sandbox VM (`HOME=/home/box`, no Codex install). gbot has **no remote transport**; it only dials a local Unix socket. When this process is on the box, do not call the Codex/Claude MCP tools there — run the `gbot` CLI on the user's machine through **Grok Bot Shell with a machineId**. On that machine, start the daemon with `codex app-server daemon start` (or bootstrap). Auth stays with each machine's native login; gbot does not store or export credentials.

**ChatGPT Desktop limitation.** Desktop runs its own private stdio app-server and does not publish the shared control socket, so external clients cannot reach live Desktop tasks. When the socket is absent, `gbot codex status` exits 1 and says so, naming the upstream issues: [openai/codex#41014](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/41014) and [openai/codex#41112](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/41112). `gbot` never reads Desktop's temporary `CODEX_APP_TOOLS_PIPE_PATH` sockets under `/tmp/codex-browser-use/`; that channel is private to Desktop.

**Pointing Desktop at the managed daemon (macOS).** Desktop injects `codex_app` overrides, so `CODEX_APP_SERVER_USE_LOCAL_DAEMON=1` alone cannot select the managed daemon. The workaround is a `CODEX_CLI_PATH` wrapper that rewrites Desktop's `codex … app-server` spawn into a stdio↔WebSocket bridge onto the managed control socket — no Desktop binary patches, no pipe scraping, no protocol change (`gbot` already speaks that socket). Do not use stock `codex app-server proxy` here: it hangs for Desktop stdio, so the shim ships its own bridge.

```sh
gbot codex desktop-shim install    # wrapper + bridge into ~/.codex/bin, LaunchAgent persists GUI env across logins
gbot codex desktop-shim status     # installed? CODEX_CLI_PATH pointing at it? daemon socket present?
gbot codex desktop-shim uninstall  # removes wrapper/bridge/LaunchAgent; Desktop falls back to stock Codex
```

Install copies the scripts out of the package into durable `~/.codex/bin/` paths, so uninstalling the npm package never leaves Desktop pointing into a deleted checkout. The wrapper exports install-time `CODEX_HOME` and derives the socket from it at runtime (`CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCK`), so custom `CODEX_HOME` layouts work; `gbot` itself resolves the socket the same way (`CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCK` wins, else `CODEX_HOME`), and `status` reports the effective path and which variable won.

Fail-open runs only before any stdin byte is consumed and no daemon payload was committed to stdout: the wrapper preflights the daemon socket (3 s deadline) and runs the bridge as a child — never `exec` — falling through to the real standalone `codex` for every non-`app-server` spawn, every preflight failure, and every pre-session bridge failure (exit 1), always on pristine stdio+stdout. The bridge's connect + WebSocket-upgrade handshake runs under one absolute monotonic deadline (`CODEX_BRIDGE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, default 10 s) requiring `HTTP/1.1 101` plus a matching `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` (a `200` fails even with a valid hash), and a first-response deadline (`CODEX_BRIDGE_FIRST_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT`, default 30 s) bounds connect-to-matching-daemon-response covering the first RPC — an unrelated notification or foreign response never satisfies it, only the matching response/error (or timeout) clears it — preflight (3 s) + upgrade (10 s) + first RPC (30 s) stays far below a daemon-lock hang, and preflight and upgrade leave stdin untouched. Reads after a successful init block with no timeout so healthy idle sessions survive silence; every mid-session socket send and stdout write runs under its own write budget (`CODEX_BRIDGE_IO_TIMEOUT`, default 30 s), so a wedged or non-reading peer cannot hang Desktop. The commit point is byte-precise on input OR output, committed before the stdout write: the bridge counts every stdin byte read (buffered readahead included, even an unforwarded blank line) and marks stdout used before writing any forwarded daemon payload via a bounded write, so the fallback only ever runs on truly pristine stdio+stdout. Buffered EOF-tail data flushes before the WS Close. A mid-session bridge failure (exit 2+) makes the wrapper exit promptly so Desktop reconnects; the fallback never runs on half-consumed stdin or dirty stdout. The wrapper never starts the daemon on the spawn path (a wedged daemon lock must not block Desktop) — upkeep belongs to the LaunchAgent login script and install, which share one `CODEX_HOME` for the GUI domain and the daemon they start; if the socket is absent, Desktop simply runs stock Codex until the daemon is started.

Residual risks, stated honestly: requests without both matching thread and turn IDs remain unanswered; a Codex client must handle those requests. A daemon that speaks framing-valid but semantically unexpected JSON-RPC (unknown methods, id-less responses) is treated as transport; pins are to app-server schema 0.158.0. The bridge trusts the local control socket; a malicious local daemon could hold the session up to the stated budgets, not past them.

Current shim limitation: Desktop's spawn-time app-tools MCP `-c` overrides are not forwarded to the already-running managed daemon. No restoration path or app-tools parity has been demonstrated here; this is not a claim of permanent protocol impossibility. Fully quit and relaunch ChatGPT.app after install (or login) so it inherits `CODEX_CLI_PATH`. `status` reads the macOS GUI-domain value via `launchctl getenv` (what Desktop actually inherits) alongside the calling shell's value. LaunchAgent persistence is macOS-first; elsewhere install still writes the wrapper and bridge but leaves `CODEX_CLI_PATH` for you to export. `~/.codex/bin` holds scripts only — there is no extra revert note to clean up; revert is `gbot codex desktop-shim uninstall` plus this section.

**ChatGPT Desktop over CDP (scaffold).** Prefer the Desktop UI surface via Chrome DevTools Protocol when you need more than the app-server socket. CDP is **local-only** (`127.0.0.1`); there is no remote transport. Relaunch the macOS app with a debug port (Electron fuses block Node inspect, not Chromium's flag):

```sh
osascript -e 'tell application "ChatGPT" to quit' \
  && open -a /Applications/ChatGPT.app --args --remote-debugging-port=9222
gbot chatgpt-desktop status
gbot chatgpt-desktop threads --limit 20
gbot chatgpt-desktop search "launch"
gbot chatgpt-desktop read <threadId>
gbot chatgpt-desktop read <threadId> --full --limit 200
gbot chatgpt-desktop send --project Launch "hello"
gbot chatgpt-desktop send --thread-id <threadId> "hello"
```

MCP tools: `chatgpt_desktop_status`, `chatgpt_desktop_list_threads`, `chatgpt_desktop_search_threads`, `chatgpt_desktop_read_thread`, `chatgpt_desktop_send`, `chatgpt_desktop_wait_reply`. List/search/read prefer the Codex app-server (`thread/list` with `modelProviders: []`, `thread/read` + `thread/turns/list`; never `thread/resume` for reads). Send / new-thread / wait / selected-thread stay on CDP; DOM read is fallback only. Desktop `local:<conversationId>` strips to the bare app-server id. Results report `backend: "cdp" | "app-server"`. Details: [docs/chatgpt-desktop-cdp.md](docs/chatgpt-desktop-cdp.md).

**Status contract (`gbot codex status --json`).** `reachable` is endpoint reachability only. `socketState` is `socket`, `absent`, `permission-denied`, or `not-a-socket`; `mode` is `daemon` for a usable daemon, otherwise the failure: `socket-absent`, `permission-denied` (the file or the connect refused this user), `not-a-socket`, `connect-failed` (socket present, nothing completed the WebSocket upgrade), `handshake-failed` (upgrade or `initialize` failed), `windows-unsupported`, or `bad-response` (reachable, but `initialize` returned something off-schema — `reachable` stays `true`). `schema.compatibility` is `exact` when the daemon reports the pinned version, `unverified` when it differs (methods usually survive upgrades, but the shapes are not re-checked), or `unknown`. `cliVersionProbe` reports whether `codex --version` answered (`ok`, `missing`, `timeout` after 3 s, `error`). The document is always written to stdout and includes `exitCode`; it is `0` only for a usable daemon.

`desktopShimConfigured` is true when the installed wrapper is selected by Desktop-facing `CODEX_CLI_PATH` (the GUI domain on macOS). This describes configuration for future launches; a running Desktop may not have inherited it, and the wrapper may have fallen back to stock Codex. `desktopAttached` is `"private-stdio"` when a Desktop-bundled app-server process is observed, otherwise `"unknown"`. That process observation and shim configuration can both be present. Neither a configured shim nor a reachable daemon proves Desktop is attached to that daemon. Verify actual attachment with a controlled shared-thread interaction and matching thread/turn IDs.

**Thread discovery.** `list-threads` is newest-activity-first (`--sort updated`, the default; `--sort created|recency`, `--order asc`) and finds old-but-active threads: `--query zerofs` (case-insensitive name/title, preview or id prefix, scanning every page, not just the first 100), `--active-within 7d` / `--since 2026-09-01`, `--cwd`, `--model-provider`, `--source-kind`, `--archived`; the `codex_threads` MCP tool takes the same fields (`query`, `activeWithin`, `since`, `sort`, `order`, ...). `--limit N` (1–200) is the page size and pages with the opaque `--cursor` from the previous `nextCursor`; JSON keeps the cursor verbatim, text output prints a sanitized `more: --cursor …` hint. Requests pass `modelProviders: []` so threads from every provider appear (the daemon otherwise filters to the current provider) and `useStateDbOnly: true` for a fast state-DB listing, falling back to a full scan when that first page is empty. Text fields are stripped of terminal control sequences in both outputs (single-line fields also lose line breaks; `preview` keeps its newlines; a structured `source` such as `{ "custom": … }` passes through unchanged), `status` is one of `notLoaded | idle | active | systemError | unknown`, and non-numeric `updatedAt` / `createdAt` become `null`. Extra fields when present: `section`, `projectId`, `modelProvider`, `model`, `originator`. Unknown arguments are rejected before the socket is touched; a response that does not match the pinned schema (including an entry without a string `id`) fails with `reason: "bad-response"`. With client-side filters (`--query`, `--since`, `--active-within`) a page can hold more matches than `--limit`; `nextCursor` is then a `gbot1:` cursor that resumes inside that page, so nothing repeats or is skipped.

**Routes, attribution, and loops.** `gbot codex send` runs on the machine that owns `CODEX_HOME`, as the user who owns the socket, with that user's Codex credentials; the socket path comes only from `CODEX_HOME` or `CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCK`, never from the message or an agent-supplied argument. gbot has no remote transport. A cloud-hosted Grok Bot on the box cannot reach a desktop socket at `/home/box/.codex/...` — use Grok Bot Shell with a machineId to run `gbot` on the user's registered machine (after `codex app-server daemon start` / bootstrap there). `GROK_BOT_CODEX_THREADS=id,id` lets the operator pin `send` to approved threads (`reason: "route-not-allowed"` otherwise). Every send gets a delivery envelope: `messageId` (also sent as Codex's native `clientUserMessageId`), `correlationId` (defaults to the message id), optional `replyTo`, and `hop`. A reply passes the original correlation id and `hop` + 1:

```sh
gbot codex send <threadId> "Grok here: build is green"                  # receipt: messageId M, correlationId M, hop 0
gbot codex send --correlation-id M --reply-to M --hop 1 <threadId> "ack" # the answer, one hop later
```

Sends at `hop >= GROK_BOT_MAX_HOPS` (default 4) are refused with `reason: "hop-limit"` before anything reaches the daemon, so two agents cannot acknowledge each other forever; `gbot` never auto-acknowledges. `--envelope` (implied by any envelope flag) prepends a one-line `[gbot msg=… corr=… reply-to=… hop=… from=user@host]` header so the receiving agent can quote the ids back. That header is caller-authored provenance for the reader, not authentication: the daemon authenticates the local user through the socket, nothing else. Private ChatGPT Desktop pipes and arbitrary ChatGPT chats stay out of scope; only Codex threads on a reachable app-server daemon are routes.

**Busy threads.** `send` reads the thread status on resume. Only `idle` and `notLoaded` threads start a turn. An `active` thread (a turn in progress, or waiting on approval / user input) is refused with `reason: "busy"`: in app-server 0.158.0 a `turn/start` on an active thread steers that turn rather than queueing behind it, by default. Explicit guarded steering and managed bridge routes can deliver into active work; they never interrupt a turn. Either wait for `list-threads` to show `idle` and resend, or pass `--when-busy queue` to hand the message to the daemon's own queue through Codex's experimental `thread/queue/add` — that needs `GROK_BOT_CODEX_EXPERIMENTAL=1`, returns `delivery: "queued"` with `queuedSubmissionId`, and `gbot codex queue <threadId>` shows what is still waiting. `systemError` threads are refused with `reason: "thread-error"` (usually an unhealthy daemon; `gbot codex status`, and on macOS check the daemon's open-file count — the login script now starts it with a raised limit), statuses this version does not know with `reason: "unknown-status"`. Receipts distinguish `delivery: "accepted"` (turn started; `turnId`, `turnStatus`), `"queued"`, `"rejected"` (nothing was sent; see `reason`), and `"unknown"` (the request left but no acknowledgment came back — look for `messageId` in the thread or queue before resending). The decision record, with the schema evidence and a live probe of the queue API, is in [`docs/codex-busy-threads.md`](docs/codex-busy-threads.md).

**Failure modes.** Every `send` and `codex` outcome under `--json` is one document on stdout with `exitCode`; failures include `{ error, delivery, reason, messageId, correlationId, hop, exitCode: 1, … }` and the process exits 1. Framework argument/schema errors remain on stderr and exit 2. `--json` is reserved anywhere before `--`; put `--` before flag-like message text. `reason` values are stable:

- `socket-absent` / `permission-denied` / `not-a-socket` / `connect-failed` / `handshake-failed` / `windows-unsupported`: the route is unavailable. Start the daemon on the user's machine (`codex app-server daemon start` / bootstrap), fix the socket, or wait for the upstream Desktop fixes. On a Grok Bot box (`HOME=/home/box`), the error explains that gbot has no remote transport and to run `gbot` via Grok Bot Shell with a machineId instead of expecting a box-local Codex socket.
- `unknown-thread`: use `list-threads`.
- `external-owner`: a thread with an active writer (VS Code, TUI) is open in another client; close it there first.
- `busy` / `thread-error` / `unknown-status`: see above.
- `route-not-allowed` / `hop-limit` / `experimental-disabled`: refused by operator policy, the relay bound, or the experimental-API gate.
- `unsupported`: the daemon does not offer the (experimental) method `--when-busy queue` needs.
- `approval-refused` (`delivery: "accepted"`): `gbot` never approves commands or file changes on your behalf. If Codex asks while `gbot` is still connected, `send` refuses the request, exits 1, and tells you the turn id. Refusal replies are armed only once `gbot`'s own `turn/start` is in flight and only for requests naming that thread/turn — an approval outstanding from another client's turn (notably ChatGPT Desktop's) during resume, a busy reject, or a queue add is recorded but never answered, and a request naming another thread or Desktop turn inside the window is foreign-silent, so `gbot` cannot reject Desktop's approval. A request naming a turn that arrives before the acknowledgment supplies `gbot`'s turn id waits instead of being classified foreign, and is answered only on a match. Requests with missing thread or turn IDs remain unanswered because ownership cannot be established. `send` disconnects as soon as the turn starts, so later approval requests stay with the daemon for a Codex client to answer; for unattended sends set `approval_policy = "never"` in the daemon's `config.toml`.
- `transport` / `bad-response` (`delivery: "unknown"`): the connection dropped or the daemon answered off-schema after the request left.

## Talking to Grok Bot from Codex

The npm package is also an [Agent Bundle](https://scriptedalchemy.github.io/agent-bundle/) plugin
that gives Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor a `grok-bot` MCP server with messaging,
Codex conversation, and managed bridge tools, plus a `talk-to-grok-bot` skill.
`gbot_send` and `gbot_thread` handle Grok conversations; `codex_threads`,
`codex_send`, `codex_new`, `codex_wait`, and `codex_watch` handle Codex conversations.
`chatgpt_desktop_*` tools drive ChatGPT Desktop over local CDP (with app-server
fallback). Claude Code and Cursor bundles also include `/gbot:codex-send`,
`/gbot:codex-threads`, and `/gbot:codex-wait` commands under `commands/`.
`gbot_bridge_start`, `gbot_bridge_status`, `gbot_bridge_stop`, and
`gbot_codex_respond` manage automatic delivery and scoped operator responses.
The tools bundle this repository's gateway client and worker, so the installed
plugin does not need `gbot` on `PATH`.

**Replying to a Codex sender.** Messages a Codex thread sends to Grok Bot
(`gbot_send` with a native or explicit `codexThreadId`, the managed bridge, its
returned answers, and `gbot send` run inside a Codex terminal via `$CODEX_THREAD_ID`)
start with `[from Codex thread <id> @ <machine>, cwd <cwd>; reply: codex_send({threadId:"<id>", message:"..."}) via MCP on <machine> (or CLI: gbot codex send <id> "...")]`.
`<machine>` is the real hostname (`GROK_BOT_MACHINE_NAME` overrides); unknown fields are left out but the thread id never is.
Find a thread to answer with `codex_threads` (`query`, `activeWithin`, newest activity first).

Install the committed bundle directly from GitHub without cloning or building it:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add ScriptedAlchemy/grok-bot-cli
codex plugin add gbot@gbot-marketplace

claude plugin marketplace add ScriptedAlchemy/grok-bot-cli
claude plugin install gbot@gbot-marketplace
```

Cursor users can add `https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/grok-bot-cli` as a
marketplace repository from Customize → Plugins. The repository-root host
marketplaces all point at the committed `artifact/` bundle.

Install the bundled host projections from the same npm package:

```sh
gbot-install install codex
gbot-install install claude
gbot-install install cursor
gbot-install install grokbot
gbot-install doctor
```

Add `--replace` to an install command to overwrite an existing copy. The bundle is
registered as `gbot`.

`gbot-install install grokbot` stages the Cursor projection as a marketplace
repository under `~/.grokbot/agent-bundle/marketplaces/gbot` (`GROK_BOT_HOME`
overrides `~/.grokbot`). On the Grok Bot computer it also sideloads gbot into Grok
Bot's existing clone of the `scriptedalchemy/plugins` marketplace: it adds `gbot/`
and a `marketplace.json` entry under the clone commit Grok Bot already uses, and
writes `plugins/cache/scriptedalchemy-plugins/gbot/<commit>/` with `.cache-complete`.
Every path it writes is recorded in the install receipt, and `uninstall grokbot`
removes exactly those paths. `--json` reports the outcome in its `sideload` field.

| Option | Environment | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--sideload-repo <owner/repo>` | `GROK_BOT_SIDELOAD_REPO` | `scriptedalchemy/plugins` |
| `--sideload-slug <slug>` | `GROK_BOT_SIDELOAD_SLUG` | `<owner>-<repo>` (`scriptedalchemy-plugins`) |
| `--no-sideload` | `GROK_BOT_SIDELOAD=0` | sideload on |
| | `GROK_BOT_AGENT_DATA_DIR` | first of `/home/box/agent-data`, `~/.grokbot/agent-data`, `~/Library/Application Support/Grok Bot/agent-data` with a `plugins/` folder |

`GROK_BOT_SIDELOAD_MARKETPLACE` from 0.12.3 is still read but must name one
repository; prefer `GROK_BOT_SIDELOAD_REPO`. The next install or uninstall removes
the 0.12.3 sideload record. `gbot-install doctor --host grokbot` reports the Grok Bot
plugin id (`AB7334`) and the sideload state (`AB7335`). Grok Bot keeps the sideloaded
cache copy only while its account plugin listing names gbot; for a durable install,
add gbot from the `ScriptedAlchemy/plugins` marketplace in Grok Bot.

`gbot_thread` returns a small receipt by default: deterministic `summary`, opaque
`cursor`, `entryCount`, and `gapReset`.
Pass the cursor back as `after` for an exclusive client-side delta. Pass `full:true`
only when bounded entry bodies are needed in structured content; `Agent.Text` remains
the short summary. Unknown cursors set `gapReset: true`; repeat that call with
`full:true` to inspect the bounded reset snapshot.

Auth resolves exactly as for `gbot`: `GROK_BOT_GATEWAY_URL` + `GROK_BOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN`,
then the Grok Bot app session, then `CURSOR_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The MCP server therefore
needs outbound HTTPS to the gateway host and read access to the app-session file
(`~/.config/Grok Bot` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Grok Bot` on macOS).
A sandbox that blocks network egress or hides the home directory makes `gbot_send`
fail with the gateway error; run `gbot doctor` inside the same sandbox to see which
credential source is visible.

For on-disk `--files` mode, pass `--dir` or set `GROK_BOT_AGENTS_DIR`.

To route a repository's agents to a bot by default, add a note to its `AGENTS.md`:

```md
## Grok Bot

Use the `grok-bot` MCP tools to coordinate with Grok Bot. Send questions and
handoffs to the `General` bot with `gbot_send` (first line: who you are and what
you need), then read the reply with `gbot_thread`. Do not block a turn waiting
for it.
```

## Local history

Recording is **opt-in**. Set `GROK_BOT_HISTORY=on` (or `true`/`1`) to append successful
`send`/`thread` observations as plaintext JSONL at
`~/.grok-bot-cli/history.jsonl`. Without that env, nothing is written.

```bash
export GROK_BOT_HISTORY=on
gbot send Researcher "Investigate the startup timeout"
gbot thread Researcher
gbot history Researcher --search timeout
gbot history --path
```

`history` works offline. Use `--history-dir` / `GROK_BOT_HISTORY_DIR` to relocate,
`--no-history` to skip one command. New dirs are `0700`, files `0600`. Conversation
text is recorded as you typed it; gateway credentials and raw response metadata are not.
